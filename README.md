# multi-st25dv-lib

STD25DV NFC Dynamic Tags Library for multiple devices platforms.

This library is a port of [ST X-CUBE-NFC4](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-expansion-packages/x-cube-nfc4.html) middleware to make a more user friendly HAL interface to allow usage in other uControllers outside ST families.

## Notes
